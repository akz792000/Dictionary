// grammer passive till Infinitive

Forgot to mention I won't be in office this week and on 16th as my daughter's kita is closed and we will take turn and manage her.
o be honest, you make me very (healthy) envious, I love having hands on that kind of stuff
How do I tell him it's not a viable career option and shut down the account while not being despised?


Dear Ali,
I am really really sorry but I have to cancel our match today, I just decided I’m not coming to the office because I am feeling sick and the pain it’s not going away despite the medicines.
I will then go on holiday but will re-schedule our meeting as soon as possible when I’m back.
Sorry again, hope you have a great day.
Valentina

No problem at all. Your health comes first. Rest up and feel better soon. We'll reschedule our meeting when both of us come back from our holiday.
